      "The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).[1] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[4][7] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March.[8][9] As of 15 July 2020, more than 13.3 million cases of COVID‑19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 580,000 deaths; more than 7.44 million people have recovered.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.[10][16][17] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[18] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[19][20] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.[10] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.[21]\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, disinfecting surfaces, increasing ventilation and air filtration indoors,[22] and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.[10][23] Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,[24] including the largest global recession since the Great Depression[25] and global famines affecting 265 million people.[26] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,[27] widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,[28][29][30] and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.[31][32] Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 172 countries, affecting approximately 98.5 percent of the world's student population.[33] Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media.[34] There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[35]\n",

      "Epidemiology\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) got reports from health authorities in China of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,[343][344] and an investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.[345] On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.[346][8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Several early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market;[347] the virus is therefore thought to be of zoonotic origin.[348] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[349] pangolin coronaviruses,[350][351] and SARS-CoV.[352] The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.[353][354] The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.[355]\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[356][357] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[358][359][360] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.[361][362]\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO recognised the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020[9] as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases. The total numbers outside China quickly surpassed China's.[363]\n",
      "\n",
      "Cases\n",
      "\n",
      "Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.[364] As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3 percent of its population.[365] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[366][367] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.[368] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.[369][370]\n",
      "\n",
      "On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[371] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[372][373] However, such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests, and due to false positives. Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[374]\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.[375] It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[376] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children were as likely to be infected as adults.[377] Countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population.[378]\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[379] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[380] R 0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.[381]\n",

      "Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[386] As of 15 July 2020, approximately 580,000[6] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 14 June , about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.[387]\n",
      "\n",
      "The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[388] The first death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[389] and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.[390]\n",
      "\n",
      "Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.[391] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting.[392] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.[393][394] In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average. In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal.[393] This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[395]\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[396] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[397][398][399] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[400] Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[401]\n",
      "\n",
      "The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.3 percent (580,038 deaths for 13,382,020 cases) as of 15 July 2020.[6] The number varies by region.[402]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known.[400] In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94 percent (95-percent confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China.[403][404] The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.[405] The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0.4 percent (0.2 to 1.0 percent) and that 35 percent of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.26 percent (as of 20 May).[406][407]\n",

      "On 11 March 2020, the WHO said the pandemic could be controlled.[9] The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location. Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, \"Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be.\"[410] The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required \"until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)\".[411] William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is \"so readily transmissible\", it \"might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year\". The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.[412]\n",

      "Signs and symptoms\n",
      "\n",
      "The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days.[10][414] Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible.[415] As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5 to 80 percent.[416]\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.[417][18][17]\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.[10] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[17] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.[18]\n",

      "Viral testing\n",

      "The standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[436]\n",

      "A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.[437] Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.[438]\n",
      "\n",
      "On 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new \"spit test\" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton, having them spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University, with results expected within 48 hours. Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs, and could enable people to conduct it at home.[439]\n",

      "Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.[440] Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[441] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.[440] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.[435]\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.[442][443] Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.[444][445] Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.[446][447]\n",
      "\n",
      "Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from areas affected by the outbreak.[448] The virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.[449]\n",
      "\n",
      "Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.[450] There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organisations are working to develop one.[451]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hand washing\n",
      "\n",
      "Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[23] CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.[442] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[443][452] It is not clear whether washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections.[453]\n",

      "Physical distancing in Toronto , with a limited number of customers allowed inside a store\n",
      "\n",
      "Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[443][454][455] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[456][457] Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.[458]\n",
      "\n",
      "The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10.[459] On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.[460] A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.[455]\n",
      "\n",
      "Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.[461][462]\n",
      "\n",
      "In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means.[463][464] Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.[465][466]\n",

      "\n",
      "Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[473] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[442] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[442] Healthcare professionals interacting directly with COVID-19 patients are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.[474]\n",

Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.[482] Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used.[22] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[483]\n",

      "The CDC recommends enhancing filtration in heating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as part of an overall risk mitigation plan, which should be designed in consultation with a professional or it may be counterproductive.[22] Doctors have been cautious about recommending air filtration because of the potentially very small size of virus particles; some filters are labelled to remove viruses to the 5-micron level, but some virus particles may be even smaller.[485] The CDC recommends increasing air filtration as high as is possible (MERV 13 or 14) without reducing design airflow; this may require replacing the current HVAC system with one that can better handle such filters, which create more resistance to air flow.[22] Other recommendations include using appropriate, correctly installed filters, running ventilation systems continuously, and creating separate ventilation zones for higher and lower risk areas of the building (e.g., individual offices on a different zone than office gym).[22] Another option may be to add freestanding air cleaners, especially in areas where virus particles are likely to be most concentrated.[22][486] In July, researchers at the University of Houston said they had designed a filter using nickel foam which used heat to kill the virus.[487] Some experts have recommended UV light inside HVAC systems.[488]\n",

Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.[493] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[494] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.[411]\n",

      "Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[489] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[489] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[495]\n",

South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.[497]\n",

Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.[918] In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.[919][920][921]\n",

(COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).', '[1] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.', '[4][7] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March.', '[8][9] As of 15 July 2020, more than 13.3 million cases of COVID‑19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 580,000 deaths; more than 7.44 million people have recovered.', '[6]\\n\\nCommon symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.', '[10][16][17] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.', '[18] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.', '[19][20] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.', '[10] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.', \"[21]\\n\\nRecommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, disinfecting surfaces, increasing ventilation and air filtration indoors,[22] and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.\", '[10][23] Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.', 'Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.', 'The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,[24] including the largest global recession since the Great Depression[25] and global famines affecting 265 million people.', '[26] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,[27] widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,[28][29][30] and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.', \"[31][32] Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 172 countries, affecting approximately 98.5 percent of the world's student population.\", '[33] Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media.', '[34] There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.', '[35]\\n\\n(4:12 min) Video summary ( script ) on the coronavirus disease\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nOn 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) got reports from health authorities in China of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,[343][344] and an investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.', '[345] On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.', '[346][8]\\n\\nSeveral early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market;[347] the virus is therefore thought to be of zoonotic origin.', '[348] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[349] pangolin coronaviruses,[350][351] and SARS-CoV.', '[352] The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.', '[353][354] The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.', '[355]\\n\\nThe earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.', '[356][357] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.', '[358][359][360] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.', '[361][362]\\n\\nThe WHO recognised the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020[9] as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases.', \"The total numbers outside China quickly surpassed China's.\", '[363]\\n\\nCases\\n\\nOfficial case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.', '[364] As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3 percent of its population.', '[365] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.', '[366][367] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.', '[368] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.', '[369][370]\\n\\nOn 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.', '[371] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.', '[372][373] However, such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests, and due to false positives.', 'Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.', '[374]\\n\\nAnalysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.', '[375] It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.', '[376] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children were as likely to be infected as adults.', '[377] Countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population.', '[378]\\n\\nInitial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[379] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).', '[380] R 0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity.', 'By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.', '[381]\\n\\nEpidemic curve of COVID-19 by date of report\\n\\nSemi-log graph showing the total (cumulative) number of confirmed cases from the first reported date for the ten most affected countries [382]\\n\\nSemi-log plot of daily new cases of COVID-19 (seven-day average) in the world and top five current countries

do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.', '[386] As of 15 July 2020, approximately 580,000[6] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.', 'In China, as of 14 June , about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.', '[387]\\n\\nThe first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.', '[388] The first death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[389] and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.', '[390]\\n\\nOfficial deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.', 'This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.', '[391] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting.', '[392] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.', '[393][394] In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average.', 'In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal.', '[393] This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.', '[395]\\n\\nMultiple measures are used to quantify mortality.', '[396] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[397][398][399] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.', '[400] Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.', '[401]\\n\\nThe death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.', 'Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.3 percent (580,038 deaths for 13,382,020 cases) as of 15 July 2020.', '[6] The number varies by region.', '[402]\\n\\nOther measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.', 'These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.', 'Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known.', '[400] In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94 percent (95-percent confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China.', \"[403][404] The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.\", '[405] The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0.4 percent (0.2 to 1.0 percent) and that 35 percent of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.26 percent (as of 20 May).', '[406][407]\\n\\nSemi-log plot of daily deaths due to COVID-19 (seven-day average) in

pandemic could be controlled.', '[9] The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.', 'Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, \"Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.', \"But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be.\", '\"[410] The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required \"until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)\".', '[411] William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is \"so readily transmissible\", it \"might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year\".', 'The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.', '[412]\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nThe usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days.', '[10][414] Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible.', '[415] As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5 to 80 percent.', '[416]\\n\\nSymptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent).', 'Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.', '[417][18][17]\\n\\nAmong those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.', '[10] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.', '[17] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.', '[18]\\n\\nCause\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nVirology\\n\\nIllustration of SARSr‑CoV virion\\n\\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.', '[352] All features of the novel SARS‑CoV‑2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.', '[431]\\n\\nSARS‑CoV‑2 is closely related to SARS‑CoV, and is thought to have a zoonotic origin.', '[349] SARS‑CoV‑2 genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, and is 96 percent identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples[432] and 92 percent identical to pangolin coronavirus.', '[433]\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nDemonstration of a swab for COVID-19 testing\\n\\nCOVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest.', '[434][435]\\n\\nViral testing\\n\\nThe standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples.', 'This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.', '[436]\\n\\nA number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.', '[437] Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.', '[438]\\n\\nOn 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new \"spit test\" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton, having them spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University, with results expected within 48 hours.', 'Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs, and could enable people to conduct it at home.', '[439]\\n\\nImaging\\n\\nCT scan of a person with COVID‑19 shows lesions (bright regions) in the lungs.', 'Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.', '[440] Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.', '[441] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.', '[440] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.', '[435]\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nStrategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container.', 'Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.', '[442][443] Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.', '[444][445] Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.', '[446][447]\\n\\nMany governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from areas affected by the outbreak.', '[448] The virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.', '[449]\\n\\nMisconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.', '[450] There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organisations are working to develop one.', '[451]\\n\\nHand washing\\n\\nHand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.', \"The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing.\", 'This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.', '[23] CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.', '[442] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.', '[443][452] It is not clear whether washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections.', '[453]\\n\\nSocial distancing\\n\\nPhysical distancing in Toronto , with a limited number of customers allowed inside a store\\n\\nSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals.', 'Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.', 'Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.', '[443][454][455] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.', '[456][457] Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.', '[458]\\n\\nThe maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10.', '[459] On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.', '[460] A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.', '[455]\\n\\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.', '[461][462]\\n\\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance.', 'The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means.', '[463][464] Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.', '[465][466]\\n\\nFace masks and respiratory hygiene\\n\\nThe CDC and WHO advise that masks reduce the spread of coronavirus by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals ( Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen pictured wearing a surgical mask)\\n\\nThe CDC and WHO recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.', '[467][468][469] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.', '[468][470] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.', '[468][470] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.', '[471][472]\\n\\nMasks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.', '[473] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.', '[442] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.', '[442] Healthcare professionals interacting directly with COVID-19 patients are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.', '[474]\\n\\nSelf-isolation\\n\\n[475] This graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population.', 'Without pandemic containment measures—such as social distancing, vaccination, and use of face masks—pathogens can spread exponentially.This graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population.', 'Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.', 'Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.', '[476][477]\\n\\nMany governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations.', '[478][479] The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups.', '[480] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.', '[10][19][481]\\n\\nSurface cleaning\\n\\nSurfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine.', 'Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.', '[482] Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used.', '[22] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.', '[483]\\n\\nVentilation and air filtration\\n\\nThe CDC recommends ventilation of all public spaces to help dilute and clear out potentially infectious aerosols.', '[22][484] This can be achieved by increasing the percentage of outside air, increasing the total airflow to occupied spaces, disabling demand-control ventilation (DCV) controls, and using natural ventilation (e.g., opening windows and doors if possible and safe).', '[22] The CDC recommends bathroom fans be working and at full capacity when people are in a building.', '[22]\\n\\nThe CDC recommends enhancing filtration in heating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as part of an overall risk mitigation plan, which should be designed in consultation with a professional or it may be counterproductive.', '[22] Doctors have been cautious about recommending air filtration because of the potentially very small size of virus particles; some filters are labelled to remove viruses to the 5-micron level, but some virus particles may be even smaller.', '[485] The CDC recommends increasing air filtration as high as is possible (MERV 13 or 14) without reducing design airflow; this may require replacing the current HVAC system with one that can better handle such filters, which create more resistance to air flow.', '[22] Other recommendations include using appropriate, correctly installed filters, running ventilation systems continuously, and creating separate ventilation zones for higher and lower risk areas of the building (e.g., individual offices on a different zone than office gym).', '[22] Another option may be to add freestanding air cleaners, especially in areas where virus particles are likely to be most concentrated.', '[22][486] In July, researchers at the University of Houston said they had designed a filter using nickel foam which used heat to kill the virus.', '[487] Some experts have recommended UV light inside HVAC systems.',

healthcare capacity (raising the line) such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, help to meet increased demand.', '[491] Goals of mitigation include delaying and reducing peak burden on healthcare () and lessening overall cases and health impact.Moreover, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity () such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, help to meet increased demand.', '[489][492] Mitigation attempts that are inadequate in strictness or duration—such as premature relaxation of distancing rules or stay-at-home orders—can allow a resurgence after the initial surge and mitigation.', 'Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression) and mitigation.', 'Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.', '[493] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading.', 'When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society.', 'A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.', '[494] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.', '[411]\\n\\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.', '[489] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.', '[489] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.', '[495]\\n\\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.', '[496] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.', 'South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.', 'Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.', 'Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.', '[497]\\n\\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.', 'Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.', 'Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.', 'Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.', '[411]\\n\\nContact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.', '[498] The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.', \"[499]\\n\\nSeveral mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.\", '[499] (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.', ')[499]\\n\\nOn 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.', '[500][501] The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.', '[502] In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.', '[503]\\n\\nHealth care\\n\\nIncreasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.', '[504] The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.', '[504][505] In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.', '[506][507][508]\\n\\nDue to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.', '[509][510] In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.', '[511][512][513] On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing.', 'NASA is seeking fast-track approval.', '[514][515]\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nAntiviral medications are under investigation for COVID-19[516] None has yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials.', '[516] However, remdesivir may affect the time it takes to recover from the virus.', '[517] Emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on 1 May, for people hospitalised with severe COVID-19.', '[518] The interim authorisation was granted considering the lack of other specific treatments, and that its potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks.', '[518][519]\\n\\nTaking over-the-counter cold medications,[520] drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.', '[442] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.', '[521] The safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a treatment option requires further research.', '[522]\\n\\nOther trials are investigating whether existing medications can be used effectively against COVID-19 or the immune reaction to it.', '[516][523] On 16 June, the RECOVERY Trial group released a statement that their preliminary results show low dose dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients receiving respiratory support,[524] though previous reviews had suggested the use of steroids may worsen outcomes.', '[525] Demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint.', '[526]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nCumulative per capita confirmed COVID-19 cases

several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.', '[527] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province.', '[361] There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were \"patient zero\".', '[361] Starting from December, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[528] and at least 266 by 31 December.', '[529]\\n\\nAccording to official Chinese sources, these early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.', '[348] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.', '[530]\\n\\nOn 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals.', 'On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.', '[531] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was

to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result.', 'Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January),[533] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.', '[534] That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\".', '[535] The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown

retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later)[540] and more may have been infected.', '[541] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\".', '[358][542] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.', '[541] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100

noodles, bread, rice, vegetables, disinfectant, and rubbing alcohol.', 'The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations.', '[902] The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g.', 'social influence and trust).', '[903] The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.', '[904] According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for

numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.', '[939]\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nThe pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple

medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary.', '\"[959] In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant,[960] and Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country.', '[961]\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\nThe outbreak prompted calls for the United States
